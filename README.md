# Project Summary

###Requirments
   In this project, I developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze credit card transaction data. The goal was to provide a comprehensive overview of customer spending patterns, identify fraudulent activities, and gain insights into key performance metrics.

Key Features:
Data Sources: The dataset included transaction details such as transaction ID, customer ID, date, merchant category, transaction amount, and card type.
Data Transformation: Utilized Power Query to clean and format the data, including handling missing values, creating calculated columns, and transforming raw data into a report-ready format.
Visualizations: The dashboard incorporated various visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to highlight spending trends, top categories, and transaction volumes over time.
Filters & Drill-Down: Enabled interactive filters and drill-down options for exploring customer-level insights and transaction patterns in detail.
Fraud Detection: Included a dedicated section to analyze suspicious transactions based on predefined risk factors, helping identify potential fraudulent activities.
Insights & Reports: The final report provided insights into customer behavior, peak transaction periods, and the overall performance of credit card operations.
